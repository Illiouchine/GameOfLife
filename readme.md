# ![](screenshots/Logo.png) Game of Life

## App Description
- This app is an implementation of the zero player game name "Game of life" by John Conway's [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

## Rules
At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

  - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
  - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
  - Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.

  - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## Setup
1. In your terminal : Clone this repo with :
```sh
git clone git@github.com:Illiouchine/GameOfLife.git
```
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Do a gradle sync
4. Now you should be able to build and deploy
5. Enjoy <3
